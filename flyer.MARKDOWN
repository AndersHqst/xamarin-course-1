# Learn Xamarin for free at e-conomic's Code Academy

Interested in learning how to build cross-platform apps for iOS and Android using Xamarin?  Look no further. This fall e-conomic will host a weekly class, where you can come learn together with full time developers. We will create a space in e-conomic's development department where you will learn with help and feedback from our developers, in a nice environment in central Copenhagen.


## What will we be doing? 
* Watch some online videos
* Give a few lectures ourselves
* Independent projects with sparring and code reviews from e-conomic's mobile developers.

## Ok, so how much is it?
It's free. We have limited slots open, but the course is free of charge. While e-conomic will supply the location, coffee, and fresh fruit, you must bring your own hard- and software.

## So what is the catch?
There is no catch. We at e-conomic would like to create a resourceful environment, get in contact with new and future developers, and show you that we have a nice work place. We will not dictate what kind of app you can and cannot build. The aim of this course is for you to learn! No strings attached.
